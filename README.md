# SDSUComputerEngineering
- These codes are the projects that I have written within my classes here at San Diego State University.

# Polymorphism Example
- This code, named Employee.cpp, utlizes the concept of polymorphism and inheritance using virtual functions.
- I use one base class and three derived classes to represent different positions.
- Each class has different functions that are specific to their position and will be called if the object is of their class.
